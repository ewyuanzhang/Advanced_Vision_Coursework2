The 2rd coursework of Advanced Vision (UoE, 2016)

Course homepage:ã€€http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/av/

## Task Description
In brief, the task is to rebuild a 3D scene by 16 views captured by a Kinect depth sensor. Steps are: 

1. Extract and remove the ground plane from the image data
2. Extract and describe the 3 spheres
3. Use the 3 spheres to register and fuse the XYZ data from all images
4. Extract the 9 planes from the data
5. Build as complete a 3D model as possible and characterise the surfaces.

Details are shown in prac21516.pdf. 

## Data

The data of 16 views can be downloaded from http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/AVDATA/AV216DATA/av_pcl.mat .
